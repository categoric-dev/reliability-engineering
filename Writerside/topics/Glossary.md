# Glossary

## Philosophical Roots

Holism & Interdependence
: The whole is more than the sum of its parts.

Emergence & Complexity
: New properties arise from interactions; patterns matter as much as parts.

Purpose‑Driven Design & Integration
: Systems must be designed to meet a purpose in context, with all stakeholders considered.

## Reliability Engineering

System Theory
: Emphasized that analysis must consider relationships, feedback loops, and context rather than isolated components. This perspective laid the groundwork for later systems thinking and engineering by insisting that models capture interactions, not just elements.

System Thinking
: Shifted focus from reductionist analysis to holistic problem‑solving, encouraging practitioners to ask “What is the structure of this system?” and “How do changes propagate?” This mindset underpins modern design, policy, and management practices.

Systems engineering
: is an interdisciplinary field of `engineering` and `engineering management` that focuses on how to design, integrate, and manage complex systems over their life cycles. It employs `systems‑thinking` principles to organize its knowledge base, and the process it follows is `discovery‑oriented`.

Reliability engineering
: is an integral sub‑discipline of systems engineering—systematically analyzes, predicts, and mitigates failure risks to ensure that complex systems consistently meet performance, safety, and availability objectives throughout their operational life, thereby establishing `robustness`.

Discovery‑oriented process
: is an iterative, `knowledge‑driven methodology` that prioritizes exploration, hypothesis testing, and continuous learning over predetermined production sequences. It emphasizes adaptability, multidisciplinary collaboration, and evidence‑based refinement to navigate the uncertainties inherent in complex system design—contrasting with manufacturing processes that focus on repeatability and cost minimization.

A knowledge‑methodology
: is a structured framework that systematically captures, organizes, validates, and applies expert knowledge to guide analysis, design, or decision‑making. By explicitly modeling concepts, relationships, and rules—and iteratively refining these models as new information emerges, it transforms tacit insights into reusable, evidence‑based knowledge that supports complex problem-solving across disciplines.
